# Ticketing System Documentation

## Overview

The AI Collaboration MCP Server includes a comprehensive ticketing system that enables better project management, issue tracking, and technical debt management. This system allows AI agents to create, track, and manage different types of tickets throughout the development lifecycle.

## Ticket Types

### 1. Bug Tickets
Track issues and defects in the codebase.

**Fields:**
- `title` - Brief description
- `description` - Detailed issue description
- `stepsToReproduce` - How to reproduce the bug
- `expectedBehavior` - What should happen
- `actualBehavior` - What actually happens
- `severity` - critical/high/medium/low
- `affectedComponents` - Which parts are affected
- `relatedCode` - References to code locations

### 2. Enhancement Tickets
Track new features and improvements.

**Fields:**
- `title` - Brief description
- `objective` - What the enhancement aims to achieve
- `rationale` - Why it's needed
- `proposedSolution` - Suggested approach
- `acceptanceCriteria` - How to know it's complete
- `priority` - high/medium/low/wishlist
- `estimatedEffort` - small/medium/large/extra-large
- `dependencies` - Other tickets or components

### 3. Technical Debt Tickets
Track code that needs refactoring or improvement.

**Fields:**
- `title` - Brief description
- `description` - What needs improvement
- `currentState` - How it currently works
- `desiredState` - How it should work
- `impact` - Effects on performance/maintainability/scalability/security
- `priority` - critical/high/medium/low/whenever
- `estimatedEffort` - Effort required
- `riskOfNotAddressing` - Consequences of not fixing

### 4. Implementation Plan Tickets
Detailed plans for complex implementations.

**Fields:**
- `title` - What's being implemented
- `relatedTickets` - Associated bug/enhancement tickets
- `overview` - High-level approach
- `technicalDesign` - Detailed design (architecture, data flow, interfaces, algorithms)
- `implementationSteps` - Ordered implementation steps
- `testingStrategy` - How it will be tested
- `rolloutPlan` - Deployment strategy
- `risks` - Potential risks and mitigations
- `estimatedTimeline` - Expected completion

## Using the Ticketing System

### Creating Tickets

```javascript
// CTO creates a bug ticket
@ai-collab create_ticket {
  "agentName": "gemini",
  "type": "bug",
  "data": {
    "title": "Register allocation fails under extreme pressure",
    "description": "When compiling deeply nested loops with many variables, register allocation crashes",
    "stepsToReproduce": ["Create nested loop with 20+ variables", "Compile with optimization"],
    "expectedBehavior": "Should spill to memory gracefully",
    "actualBehavior": "Crashes with 'out of registers' error",
    "severity": "high",
    "affectedComponents": ["register_allocator", "spill_manager"]
  }
}
// Response: Created bug ticket: BUG-0001
```

```javascript
// Developer creates tech debt ticket
@ai-collab create_ticket {
  "agentName": "claude",
  "type": "techDebt",
  "data": {
    "title": "Refactor spill slot allocation algorithm",
    "description": "Current O(nÂ²) algorithm is inefficient for large functions",
    "currentState": "Naive nested loop checking all slots",
    "desiredState": "Graph coloring or interval tree approach",
    "impact": {
      "performance": "Slow compilation for large functions",
      "maintainability": "Complex code that's hard to modify"
    },
    "priority": "medium",
    "estimatedEffort": "large"
  }
}
// Response: Created techDebt ticket: DEBT-0001
```

### Viewing Tickets

```javascript
// Get all open tickets
@ai-collab get_tickets {"status": "open"}

// Get high priority bugs
@ai-collab get_tickets {"type": "bug", "priority": "high"}

// Get all tickets
@ai-collab get_tickets {}

// View specific ticket
@ai-collab ai-collab://tickets/BUG-0001
```

### Updating Tickets

```javascript
// Update ticket status
@ai-collab update_ticket {
  "ticketId": "BUG-0001",
  "updates": {"status": "in_progress"},
  "agentName": "claude"
}

// Add information
@ai-collab update_ticket {
  "ticketId": "BUG-0001",
  "updates": {
    "status": "resolved",
    "resolution": "Implemented register pressure detection with early spilling"
  },
  "agentName": "claude"
}
```

### Linking Tickets to Missions

```javascript
// Link bug to current mission
@ai-collab link_ticket_to_mission {
  "ticketId": "BUG-0001",
  "missionId": "MISSION-1234567890"
}
```

## Workflow Integration

### During Code Review

```javascript
// CTO notices issue during review
Gemini: "I see a potential performance issue here. Let me create a ticket."

@ai-collab create_ticket {
  "agentName": "gemini",
  "type": "techDebt",
  "data": {
    "title": "Optimize loop iteration in register allocator",
    "description": "Current implementation iterates through all registers for each variable",
    "priority": "low",
    "estimatedEffort": "small"
  }
}

// Continue with review
"Created DEBT-0002 for future optimization. For now, the implementation is correct."
```

### Planning Complex Features

```javascript
// Architect creates implementation plan
@ai-collab create_ticket {
  "agentName": "gemini",
  "type": "implementationPlan",
  "data": {
    "title": "SSA-based register allocation",
    "relatedTickets": ["ENH-0003", "BUG-0001"],
    "overview": "Replace current allocator with SSA-based approach",
    "technicalDesign": {
      "architecture": "Three-phase: SSA construction, allocation, destruction",
      "dataFlow": "IR -> SSA -> Allocated SSA -> Machine code",
      "interfaces": "Compatible with existing IR structures"
    },
    "implementationSteps": [
      "Implement SSA construction",
      "Create interference graph builder",
      "Implement graph coloring allocator",
      "Add SSA destruction phase",
      "Integration and testing"
    ],
    "testingStrategy": "Unit tests for each phase, integration tests with real programs",
    "estimatedTimeline": "3-4 weeks"
  }
}
```

## Ticket Reports

View comprehensive ticket status:

```javascript
@ai-collab ai-collab://tickets

// Returns:
{
  "tickets": [...all tickets...],
  "report": {
    "summary": {
      "total": 15,
      "byType": {
        "bug": 5,
        "enhancement": 4,
        "techDebt": 6
      },
      "byStatus": {
        "open": 8,
        "in_progress": 3,
        "resolved": 4
      },
      "byPriority": {
        "critical": 1,
        "high": 3,
        "medium": 7,
        "low": 4
      }
    },
    "details": {
      "openBugs": [...high priority bugs...],
      "criticalItems": [...all critical/high priority...],
      "recentlyCreated": [...last 7 days...],
      "recentlyUpdated": [...recently modified...]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create tickets proactively** - Don't wait for issues to become critical
2. **Link related items** - Connect tickets to missions and tasks
3. **Update status regularly** - Keep ticket status current
4. **Use appropriate priorities** - Reserve "critical" for truly blocking issues
5. **Document thoroughly** - Future you will thank present you
6. **Review tickets periodically** - Part of CTO's responsibilities

## Integration with Autonomous Workflows

The ticketing system integrates seamlessly with missions:

- Tickets can be created during any phase of development
- High-priority tickets can trigger new missions
- Mission completion can automatically close related tickets
- Technical debt is tracked without blocking current work

This creates a comprehensive project management system that maintains quality while enabling continuous progress.
